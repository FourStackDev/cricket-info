Steps for Eureka Server and Client
##########################################

Eureka Server
--------------

1. Create the Eureka server spring project using Eureka Server as dependency.

2. Add JAXB dependencies (required only on Java9 onwards)

3. Add @EnableEurekaServer annotation to the main class

4. To overcome the intialize error add port (not mandatory) and other properties
	- For application.properties
			#Configure the Server Port
			server.port=8761

			#Configure Eureka Server to not to configure itself as a Client
			eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false
			eureka.client.fetch-registry=false
	
	- For application.yml
	       #Configure the Server Port
			server:
                port: 8761


          #Configure Eureka Server to not to configure itself as a Client
            eureka:
                client:
                    register-with-eureka: false
                    fetch-registry: false
                    
                    
Eureka Client
--------------
1. Add Eureka client dependency to services (along with the spring.cloud.version property) - download from the start.spring.io

2. Add spring cloud dependencies in dependencyManagement section

3. Eureka clients will be registered as UNKNOWN. To overcome this add application name in application.properties or application.yml
	Ex: spring.application.name=player-info-service
	
4. Add @EnableEurekaClient (not mandatory) - For the services those are acting as clients.


5. Add @LoadBalanced annotation to the RestTemplate beans

6. Update the urls with service name
	-> http://localhost:8082/api/v1/player-info/players-profiles  To 
	http://player-info-service/api/v1/player-info/players-profiles
